## Flood Sense and Response : A Hybrid Flood Prediction and Detection System
Flood disasters pose a recurring and escalating threat in many regions of India, driven by climate change, unplanned urbanization, and inadequate early-warning mechanisms. AI-Driven Flood Detection and Prediction System with Intelligent Alerting (Flood sense and response), aims to address these challenges by leveraging artificial intelligence, modern web technologies, and automated communication platforms. The system analyzes environmental and scenario-based inputs to detect potential flood conditions and predict risk levels using machine learning models. A web-based dashboard enables users to interact with the system, submit flood-related parameters, and receive AI-generated interpretations of flood scenarios. 

## About
Flood Sense and Response aims to leverage machine learning models, natural language processing, and automated alert mechanisms to analyze environmental parameters and user-provided flood scenarios. By transforming raw data into meaningful risk assessments and AI-generated explanations, the system enables users to understand flood severity and potential consequences in a clear and actionable manner.

Beyond prediction and analysis, the platform emphasizes timely and reliable communication through the integration of Telegram-based alert delivery. This approach ensures fast dissemination of flood warnings and advisories without dependence on traditional SMS systems or complex geospatial mapping. Designed as a modular and scalable web application, the project prioritizes accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, laying the foundation for a proactive flood management framework

The current flood monitoring and disaster response mechanisms suffer from several critical limitations, including delayed risk assessment, fragmented data analysis, and limited public accessibility. Many existing systems rely heavily on manual reporting, static thresholds, or complex sensor-based infrastructures that are expensive to deploy and difficult to maintain.
